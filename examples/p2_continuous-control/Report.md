#### Report
    The submission includes a file in the root of the GitHub repository or zip file 
    (one of Report.md, Report.ipynb, or Report.pdf) that provides a description of 
    the implementation.

Yes, this is the document being read.


#### Learning Algorithm
    The report clearly describes the learning algorithm, along with the chosen hyperparameters. 
    It also describes the model architectures for any neural networks.

Please read section Methods and Algorithms.


#### Plot of Rewards
    A plot of rewards per episode is included to illustrate that the agent is able to receive an average reward (over 100 episodes) of at least +13. The submission reports the number of episodes needed to solve the environment.


#### Ideas for Future Work
    The submission has concrete future ideas for improving the agent's performance.
